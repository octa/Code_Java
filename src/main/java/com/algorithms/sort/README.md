### Insertion Sort

Just like cards where you compare with every element and insert into the correct position.

Start from left+1 to the right. Make the number in question as the key and compare with all the elements to the left.

This will start creating a sorted list starting from left. Smaller numbers will be left and you build the list as you go towards right.
